# This was a skript that I had to develop because our multiverse plugin did some weird stuff...

on portal enter:
    if event-world is "world_the_end":
        if event-entity is a player:
            if {spawnpoint.%uuid of player%} is set:
                teleport player to {spawnpoint.%uuid of player%}
            else:
                teleport player to spawn

on right click on any bed:
    set {spawnpoint.%uuid of player%} to location of event-block

every 20 ticks:
    loop all players:
        loop blocks from {spawnpoint.%uuid of loop-player%} to {spawnpoint.%uuid of loop-player%}:
            if loop-block is not any bed:
                delete {spawnpoint.%uuid of loop-player%}
